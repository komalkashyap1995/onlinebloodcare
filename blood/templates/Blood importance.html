			 <h3><img src="/static/images/drop2.jpeg" alt="drop" class="drop"> What is blood?</h3> 
            <p class="text-justify">One can almost say that blood is that magic potion which gives life 
            to another person. Though we have made tremendous discoveries and inventions 
            in Science we are not yet able to make the magic potion called Blood. 
             Human blood has no substitute. Requirement of safe blood is increasing 
            and regular voluntary blood donations are vital for blood transfusion 
            services.</p>
          
		  
		  <h3><img src="/static/images/drop2.jpeg" alt="drop" class="drop"> How much blood is taken?</h3>
		  <p>Our body has 5.5 ltr of blood of which only 350 ml - 450 ml of blood 
          is taken depending upon weight of donor. Majority of healthy adults 
          can tolerate withdrawal of one unit of blood. The withdrawn blood volume 
          is restored within 24 hours and the hemoglobin and cell components are 
          restored in 2 months. Therefore it is safe to donate blood every three 
          months.</p>
		  
		  <h3><img src="/static/images/drop2.jpeg" alt="drop" class="drop"> Who can donate blood?</h3> 
       <p>Donor should be between 18-55 years of age with a weight of 50 kg or 
          above with pulse rate, body temperature and blood pressure should be 
          normal. Both men and women can donate. There are only few conditions 
          in which donors are permanently excluded. The donor with history of 
          epilepsy, psychotic disorders, abnormal bleeding tendencies, severe 
          asthma, cardiovascular disorders, malignancy are permanently unfit for 
          blood donation. Donors suffering from disease like hepatitis, malaria, 
          measles, mumps, and syphilis may donate blood after full recovery with 
          3-6 months gap. Also people who have undergone surgery, blood transfusion 
          may safely donate blood after 6-12 mths for woman donors who are pregnant 
          or lactating blood is not taken as their iron reserves are already on 
          the lower side. </p>

          OF LIFE</strong>'.
