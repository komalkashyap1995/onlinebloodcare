				<h2>Why donate blood?</h2>								
			</div>
				
		<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8">
			<br>		
			<p>Blood is the part of life that is given to those who need it by those who have the resource to satisfy the need. The love of fellow human and a desire to share something of oneself is what singles out a blood donor from the others. Emergencies occur every minute. For each patient requiring blood, it is an emergency and the patients could have set back if blood is not available. </p>
			<ul>
		   <li>Your blood donation may be even more special than you realize.</li>
		   <li>A single donation from you can help one or more patients.</li>
		   <li>This is possible because whole blood is made up of several useful components.</li>
		   <li>These components perform special functions in your body and in the body of patients who receive your blood. </li>
		   <li>Various blood components are Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, Plasma and selected Plasma Proteins.</li>
		   <li>Each of these components can be separated from your donated volume of blood and transfused into a specific patient requiring that particular component.</li>
		   <li>Thus, many can benefit from one unit of blood. Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.</li>
